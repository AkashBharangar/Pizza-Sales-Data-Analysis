## üìù Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of pizza sales with the goal of uncovering trends and patterns. Through data exploration, cleaning, and visualization, I identified actionable insights regarding sales volume, peak sales times, popular pizza types, and revenue trends.

## üíª Data and Tools

### Data
The dataset used includes transaction-level data for a fictional pizza company, detailing sales across various pizza types, sizes, and times.

### Tools
- **SQL**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
- **Excel**: Assisted in data cleaning, initial exploration, and basic visualizations.
- **Power BI**: Created interactive visualizations and dashboards for deeper insights.

## üîç Steps and Methodology

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Imported the data into SQL and Excel to clean missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate records.
   - Standardized column names and formats to ensure consistency across analyses.

2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Created SQL queries to:
     - Filter and summarize sales data based on pizza type, size, and topping preferences.
     - Identify peak sales times and busiest days.
     - Calculate total revenue and average order values.
   - Extracted key insights from SQL results, focusing on popular items, customer preferences, and time-based trends.

3. **Excel Analysis**
   - Performed initial visual analysis in Excel with pivot tables and charts.
   - Identified initial patterns in sales distribution, pizza popularity, and sales trends across time.

4. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**
   - Imported the cleaned data into Power BI.
   - Built interactive dashboards showing:
     - Monthly and yearly sales trends.
     - Top-selling pizzas by category.
     - Sales heatmap by day and time.
     - Revenue breakdown by pizza type and size.

## üìä Insights and Findings

- **Top-selling Pizzas**: The Pepperoni Pizza is the MOST SELLING Pizza.
- **Peak Sales Hours**: Orders are MAXIMUM on Weekends at 12 PM - 1 PM and at 5 PM - 6 PM.
- **Revenue Trends**: Classic Category contributes to maximum sales & total orders.
